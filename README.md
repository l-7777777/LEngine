# VoidP
###### A game engine
This is VoidP - a game engine. It's not very far along in development, so for now,
this page will show things to do, and visions of what it will be.

## To Do
1. Add event handling
2. Make it render stuff (yay!)
3. Make the ECS

## Visions
VoidP is going to be a fully featured game engine built on ~~OpenGL~~Vulkan*. So far it only
runs on Windows, because that's the machine that I have. If anybody would like to
try to port it, you can go ahead and DM me on Discord
([@lylythechosenone](https://discord.com/users/575985990099927040)). I plan to have
both 2d and 3d support. GameObjects will be empty objects on which you can add 
"components" (a camera, a transform, a script, etc.). Scripts will be written in
C++, starting with a script to initialize the game itself and assign a window.

## Using
The steps to using VoidP are documented in the Wiki.
